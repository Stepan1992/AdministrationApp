# AdministrationApp

This app was written with AngularJS. A user can manipulate information in MySQL database. I am using Knex.js for creating queries on the server side. A lot of node modules was used in this app such as Express and dotenv. Administrator has a rights to add new user and give them some access rights. The app created with the example of school management service.
